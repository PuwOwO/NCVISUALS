# NCVISUALS
List of visuals for the best client in tf2

Notes :
All except grey are older configs, they will be updated later to follow the the same render groups(this means the render groups are messy/bit off).

some NCVP's use "Clean PRNTSC", to disable this goto Visual>misc>Clean render and untick "Clean PRNTSC".

when importing/exporting NC CFGS u might crash, so type out the name manualy to prevent said crashes(u can still crash anyways, no way to prevent it)
